## Examples

Round at a given decimal point:

    4.555.ceil_at(1)  #=> 4.6
    4.555.floor_at(1)  #=> 4.5
    4.555.round_at(1)  #=> 4.6
    4.555.truncate_at(1)  #=> 4.5

Round to a given precision:

    4.555.ceil_to(0.1)   #=> 4.6
    4.555.floor_to(0.1)  #=> 4.5
    4.555.round_to(0.1)  #=> 4.6
    4.555.truncate_to(0.1)  #=> 4.5

Conceptually, the methods for round, floor, ceil, and truncate will typically be for floating point numbers.
However, these methods can actually be for pretty much any Numeric object.
For example, one could round an Integer to the nearest kilo.


## Credit

These methods are based on the Facets library for Ruby and the developer named Trans. 

The #round_at and #round_to methods are exact copies and fully compatible with Facets. The rest of the methods are very similar code and fully co-existant with Facets. 

We're asking the Facets team to consider including the rest of the methods.


## Changes

* 2012-09-01 1.0.2 Add #truncate_at and #truncate_to; improve floating division.
* 2012-05-30 1.0.0 Create baesd on Facets methods by Trans.
